# BPF Tester

This is a simple tool to test eBPF programs generated by `genpay`.

## How to use

1.  **Generate an eBPF object file using `genpay`:**
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin genpay -- --bpf <path-to-your-genpay-file>.pay
    ```
    This will create an object file named `a.o` in the current directory.

2.  **Run the `bpf-tester` with the generated object file:**
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin bpf-tester a.o
    ```

    The `bpf-tester` will load the eBPF program from the object file, execute it, and print the result.
